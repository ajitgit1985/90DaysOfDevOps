 Day 1
1.	 What is DevOps
DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.
Key principles of DevOps include:
1.	Collaboration: Encouraging close cooperation between development, operations, and other stakeholders to foster shared goals and responsibilities.
2.	Continuous Integration (CI): Developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository, and automated tests are executed to detect integration issues early.

3.	Continuous Delivery (CD): Code changes that pass through CI are automatically deployed to production-like environments, enabling rapid and reliable software releases.

4.	Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automating infrastructure provisioning and configuration using code, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.

5.	Monitoring and Logging: Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure, along with centralized logging, to gain insights into performance, detect issues, and improve reliability.

6.	Automation: Automating repetitive tasks, including testing, deployment, and infrastructure management, to reduce human errors and increase efficiency.

7.	Agile Practices: Incorporating Agile methodologies to promote iterative development and respond to changing requirements more effectively.

2.	What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?
Automation:
Automation involves the use of technology and software tools to perform tasks or processes with minimal human intervention. In the context of software development and operations, automation aims to streamline repetitive tasks, increase efficiency, and reduce manual errors. Various aspects of the software development lifecycle can be automated, including code testing, build and deployment processes, infrastructure provisioning, and monitoring.
For example, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes automate the building, testing, and deployment of code changes. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows automation of infrastructure provisioning and configuration, making it easier to manage and scale resources.

Scaling:
Scaling refers to the ability of a system, application, or infrastructure to handle increased demands and workloads. In the context of cloud computing, scaling can be categorized into two types:

a. Vertical Scaling (Scale Up): Involves increasing the capacity of individual resources, such as adding more CPU, memory, or storage to a single server or virtual machine. This approach has its limits and may lead to higher costs as more powerful hardware is required.

b. Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out): Involves adding more instances or nodes to distribute the workload across multiple servers or virtual machines. This approach allows for better utilization of resources and provides the ability to handle larger workloads by adding more instances in response to increased demand.


Infrastructure:
Infrastructure, in the context of software development and operations, refers to the underlying foundation required to host, deploy, and run applications and services. This infrastructure can be physical hardware, virtual machines, containers, or a combination of these resources.
Traditional infrastructure involved physical servers and data centres, but with the advent of cloud computing, organizations now have access to scalable and flexible cloud infrastructure services provided by major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). These cloud services allow businesses to rent computing resources on-demand, paying only for what they use, without the need to manage physical hardware.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a key DevOps practice that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure using code, which allows for consistent and repeatable setups. Tools like Terraform and AWS Cloud Formation facilitate the implementation of IaC.

3. Why DevOps is important

DevOps is important for several compelling reasons that significantly impact software development, IT operations, and overall business success. Here are some key reasons why DevOps is considered crucial:

•	Faster Software Delivery
•	Increased Collaboration and Communication
•	Improved Software Quality
•	Enhanced Reliability and Stability
•	Efficient Resource Utilization
•	Continuous monitoring and logging
•	Continuous Improvement
•	Business Agility
